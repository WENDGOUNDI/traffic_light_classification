# traffic_light_classification
The standard traffic light is composed of three colors: red light for STOP, the green light for GO and the yellow light to WARN THE DRIVERS THAT THE RED SIGNAL IS ABOUT TO APPEAR.  The main objective of traffic light is to regulate traffic’s movement, generally placed at road intersections and crossings. A conclusion of an eight-years study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration revealed an average of 1578 fatalities each year resulting from at least two vehicles traffic crashes. These crashes often happen at intersections controlled by traffic signals and 51% of those fatal crashes were caused by drivers who ran red lights.  To solve this issue, in this project, we used a deep learning model to classify traffic lights state divided into four classes:  "red", "yellow", "green", "off". By using a light self-build network architecture, we obtained 96.04% as training accuracy and 95.61% as validation accuracy. The test accuracy is 95.53%, demonstrating the efficiency of the model. This project is a starting point to develop a fully artificial intelligence system to monitor our traffic movement. Such system can be implemented into self-driving cars to improve drivers and pedestrians’ safety.
